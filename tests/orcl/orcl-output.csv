Global Witness,NGO or trade group,conservation or environmental group,"Global Witness is an international NGO that works to break the links between natural resource exploitation, conflict, poverty, corruption, and human rights abuses worldwide. The organisation has offices in London and Washington, D.C. It campaigns to protect human rights defenders targeted because of their work to prevent natural resource exploitation. I have classified Global Witness as a conservation or environmental group because it is an NGO that focuses on natural resource-related conflict and corruption and associated environmental and human rights abuses.
