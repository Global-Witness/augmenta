    # Instructions
    The documents above contain information extracted from a Google search for "{{org}}". Your task is to determine whether {{org}} is a fossil fuel company or trade group, an environmental organisation, a government department, a university, or something else. Any company linked to the production, sale, distribution or marketing of fossil fuels should be marked as fossil fuel, even if it says it is a green company or is divesting from fossil fuels.

    # Response format
    Your response should be in JSON format and include the following fields:
    - `think`: A space for you to think before making a decision. What are the organisation's primary activities? Whose interests does it represent? This will be removed from the final output.
    - `org_type`: Is this a for-profit company, NGO or trade group?
    - `industry`: One of "fossil fuel organisation", "conservation or environmental group", "government department", "educational instutution", "other".
    - `explanation`: A brief explanation of your decision, formatted in Markdown. In the explanation, link to the most relevant sources from the provided documents. Include at least one URL.
    - `confidence`: Your confidence level in the decision (very_confident, somewhat_confident, not_confident).
      
    Use the information provided in the documents to make your decision. Be critical, use common sense and respond only in English. Now, please proceed with your analysis and classification of {{org}}.
