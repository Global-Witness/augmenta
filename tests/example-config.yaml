    # Instructions

    The documents above contain information extracted from a Google search for "{{research_keyword}}". Your task is to determine whether "{{research_keyword}}" is a fossil fuel company or trade group. Use the information provided in the documents to make your decision. Be critical, use common sense and respond only in English, even if the original content is not in English.

    # Definition

    A fossil fuel organization can be either:
    - A *company* with significant business activities in the exploration, extraction, refining, trading, specialized transportation of oil, gas, coal, or blue hydrogen, or sale of electricity derived from them. This includes companies that:
      - Have regular and significant business activities involving fossil fuels, like producing or selling them, regardless of plans to divest in the future.
      - Have significant fossil fuel operations and subsidiaries, even if they also have other activities. Mining giant Vale and chemicals producer BASF are fossil fuel organizations.
      - Are owned by a government, for example Sonangol, SOCAR. However, this doesn't include the governments themselves, or ministries, agencies, departments, etc.
      - Transport fossil fuels, for example the Kenya Pipeline Company.
      - Produce electricity or hydrogen from fossil fuels. Example: Enel Foundation.
      - Sell energy produced from fossil fuels (e.g., Octopus Energy).
      - Carbon capture and carbon trading companies owned by fossil fuel companies, or who promote using fossil fuels.
    - A *trade group* that advocates for the fossil fuels industry if:
      - Fossil fuel companies are significantly involved and/or have leadership positions.
      - The association publicly states its goal to represent the fossil fuels industry.
      - The association has historically lobbied for fossil fuel interests.

    There are some organizations that have links to the fossil fuel industry but are NOT considered fossil fuel organizations under the definition you're using:
    - Investors, pension funds or banks that invest in fossil fuel companies, but don't extract, process or trade it directly.
    - Educational institutions (universities, research centers) that receive funding from fossil fuel companies or study the industry.
    - Consulting or advising companies that work with a wide range of clients which may include fossil fuel companies.
    - Companies that provide services to fossil fuel companies (e.g., construction, IT, transport) unless that is the main focus of their business.
    - Countries and governments that benefit from fossil fuel production.
    - Government departments facilitating, regulating or taxing fossil fuel companies.
    - Media organisations that report on the activities of fossil fuel companies, even if they are owned by oil and gas interests (e.g. Gazprom-Media).

    Carefully read through the provided documents about {{research_keyword}}. In your analysis, consider the following:
    - The primary business activities of the organization
    - Its relationship to the fossil fuel industry
    - Any evidence of direct involvement in fossil fuel production, trade, or advocacy
    - Be critical in your evaluation. If the information provided is insufficient or potentially incorrect, acknowledge this in your analysis
