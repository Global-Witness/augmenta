    # Instructions

    Your job is to research "{{DonorName}}", a donor to a political party in the UK. Your will determine what industry {{DonorName}} belongs to. The entity could be a company, a trade group, a union, an individual, etc.
    
    If {{DonorName}} is an individual, you should classify them based on their profession or the industry they are closest associated with. If the documents are about multiple individuals, or if it's not clear which individual the documents refer to, please set the industry to "Don't know" and the confidence level to 1. For example, there's no way to know for certain that someone named "John Smith" in the documents is the same person as the donor in the Electoral Commission.

    We also know that the donor is a {{DonorStatus}}.

    ## Searching guidelines

    In most cases, you should start by searching for {{DonorName}} without any additional parameters. Where relevant, remove redundant words like "company", "limited", "plc", etc from the search query. If you need to perform another search, try to refine it by adding relevant keywords like "industry", "job", "company", etc. Note that each case will be different, so be flexible and adaptable. Unless necessary, limit your research to two or three searches.

    With each search, select a few sources with `mcp-server-fetch-python` that are most likely to provide relevant information. Access them using the tools provided. Be critical and use common sense. ALWAYS cite your sources.
    
    Now, please proceed with your analysis and classification of {{DonorName}}.
