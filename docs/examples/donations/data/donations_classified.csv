Conservative and Unionist Party,David E Jay,Individual,,833,"The documents provided contain information about multiple individuals named David Jay. The first document discusses David Jay as an asexual activist and founder of the Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN), which is related to social activism and education.
